<h2>Function to find nonparametric BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> intervals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package bootBCa exports only a single function, BCa.
</p>
<p>Function BCa finds confidence intervals using Efron's nonparametric
bias-corrected and accelerated (BC<sub><i>a</i></sub>) bootstrap method.
</p>
<p>Function BCa was based on function <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/bootstrap/docs/bcanon">bcanon</a> in the R package
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootstrap/index.html">bootstrap_2012.04-1</a> but was significantly enhanced.  Functional differences
include:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Implement adaptive bootstrap.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduce memory required by a factor of nboot.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Utilize the quantile function from stats, replacing code that contained
an off-by-one error.*
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add option to use different types of quantiles.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eliminate superfluous returns; add returns for bootstrap estimate,
attained precision, and the number of bootstrap replications done.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change default alpha to just c(0.025,0.975).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add some error checks.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If all values in x are the same, skip the bootstrap and return
theta(x,...) for all requested quantiles.**
</p>
</li></ol>

<p>* This bug persists in bootstrap_2014.4 but has been reported to the new
maintainer and should be fixed in the next version.
</p>
<p>** In this degenerate case, boot_1.3-9 crashes and bootstrap_2012.04-1 returns NAs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
BCa(x, delta, theta, ..., alpha = c(0.025, 0.975), verbose = F,
    M = 25000, Mlimit = 1500000, qtype = 1)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>The data (vector).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>delta</code></td>
<td>

<p>Requested precision.  The number of bootstrap replications is adapted dynamically to deliver the requested precision using the procedure described in <a href="#GUMs1">JCGM 101:2008</a> section 7.9.4.  Beware, the number of replications needed grows explosively if delta is too small.  If delta is NA, just do M replications (non-adaptive).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>theta</code></td>
<td>

<p>Function returning the statistic of interest (e.g., mean).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Additional arguments for theta (optional).
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of quantiles for the desired BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> confidence intervals.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>

<p>Set verbose to T to get a progress report on the adaptive bootstrap process and other details as the BCa function runs.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>M</code></td>
<td>

<p>Bootstrap replication batch size.  Adaptive does at least 2M
replications before it can terminate.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Mlimit</code></td>
<td>

<p>Stop increasing the number of bootstrap replications if it takes more than
this number to make delta.  When delta is NA this parameter is irrelevant.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>qtype</code></td>
<td>

<p>Use this type of quantile.  The value of qtype is an integer between 1 and 9
selecting one of the nine quantile algorithms implemented by the
<a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/quantile.html">quantile</a> function in <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/stats-package.html">stats</a>.  The
default, type 1, is the inverse of the empirical distribution function with
no interpolation between values and is closest to what was originally
implemented in <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/bootstrap/docs/bcanon">bcanon</a>.  See also <a href="#HyndmanFan">Hyndman and Fan</a>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The output is a vector:
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>[1], &quot;nboot&quot;</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of bootstrap replications done.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>[2], &quot;prec&quot;</code></td>
<td>
<p>Estimate of attained precision.  This can exceed delta if the
iterations limit Mlimit is reached before the requested precision
is achieved.  For non-adaptive, this is NA or 0.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>[3], &quot;est&quot;</code></td>
<td>
<p>Bootstrap estimate (mean of the <i>&theta;&#x0302;*</i> values).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rest, &quot;0.xxx&quot;</code></td>
<td>
<p>Points corresponding to alpha values.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Stop conditions and special cases</h3>


<ol>
<li><p>Most invalid parameter values result in an immediate stop.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If theta returns a non-scalar value (i.e., a value of length not equal to 1), the function will stop with &ldquo;BCa: theta returned a non-scalar value.&rdquo;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If all values in x are the same, including if x is of length 1, no bootstrapping is done.  Instead, zero is returned for the number of bootstrap replications and the estimate of attained precision, and theta(x,...) is returned for the bootstrap estimate and all requested quantiles.  In this special case, theta(x,...) is allowed to be non-numeric, infinite, or NaN.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>In all other cases, if theta returns a non-finite or non-numeric value, including NA or NaN, the function will stop with &ldquo;theta returned a non-(finite,numeric) value.&rdquo;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the value of theta is always the same after removing any single element from x, the function will stop with &ldquo;acceleration is indeterminate for insensitive function.&rdquo;  In such cases, other kinds of bootstrap intervals (not implemented in this package) can still be used.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The function will stop with &ldquo;BCa: alpha value too extreme for these data&rdquo; if an alpha value is so close to 0 or 1 that the BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> interval becomes invalid.
</p>
</li></ol>



<h3>Limitations of the BCa function</h3>

<p>There is no support for doing multiple statistics simultaneously, nor does the function parallelize internally.  However, multiple invocations of the function can profitably be run in parallel on different data (e.g., different treatments of an experiment).
</p>
<p>As described in <a href="#GUMs1">JCGM 101:2008</a> section 7.9.4, the convergence criterion for the
adaptive method corresponds to a coverage probability of approximately 95 %.
In other words, even when the returned estimate of attained precision is
numerically less than delta and the number of bootstrap replications done was
not limited by Mlimit, there is approximately a 5 % probability that the
precision attained was actually worse than delta (numerically greater than
delta).
</p>
<p>Stopping when theta returns infinity is overkill in the non-adaptive case
where an infinity in the set of <i>&theta;&#x0302;*</i> values might
merely cause the bootstrap estimate to become infinite.  On the other hand,
an infinity arising during the jacknife is fatal, even in non-adaptive, so
continuing with business as usual after the theta function has been
demonstrated to return infinities is arguably masking a fault.
</p>


<h3>Contraindications for use of the BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> method</h3>

<p>Like the ordinary percentile interval, the BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> interval becomes
inaccurate when the number of bootstrap replications is not much larger than
<i>1/min(&alpha;,1&minus;&alpha;)</i> because there are not
enough <i>&theta;&#x0302;*</i> values from which to extract the
desired quantile (e.g., one cannot plausibly estimate a 99 % quantile given
fewer than 100 values).  However, the bias correction and acceleration
adjustments made in BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> can result in a more extreme quantile being
needed.  Therefore, BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> intervals are contraindicated if it is not
possible to use a generously large value of M.
</p>
<p>Although it depends on the distribution, the empirical error rate of
BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> intervals tends to significantly exceed the nominal error rate
when the sample size is very small (on the order of 10).  Examples are given
in <a href="#DavisonHinkley">Davison and Hinkley</a> and <a href="#CarpenterBithell">Carpenter and Bithell</a>.
</p>
<p>Carpenter and Bithell show that the coverage error for BC<sub><i>a</i></sub>
increases as alpha values approach 0 or 1.  Specifically, Efron's function
<i>z<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(z<sub>0</sub>+z<sup>(&alpha;)</sup>)/(1&minus;a(z<sub>0</sub>+z<sup>(&alpha;)</sup>))</i>,</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML#Web_browsers">MathML</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="z0 + (z0+zalpha)/(1-a(z0+zalpha))">

    </mrow>
  </math>
</p>
<p>approaches <i>z<sub>0</sub> &minus; 1/a</i> instead
of infinity as <i>z<sup>(&alpha;)</sup></i> becomes infinite.  There is thus
concern about coverage error when alpha values become &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; in
context of the acceleration and bias estimates arising from the data
provided.  In the maintainer's experience, with non-contrived data, this
particular error remains insignificant for all practically useful values of
alpha.  Unequivocally, however, Efron's function has a pole where <i>z<sub>0</sub>+z<sup>(&alpha;)</sup> = 1/a</i> and produces invalid results when
<i>a(z<sub>0</sub>+z<sup>(&alpha;)</sup>) &ge; 1</i>.  The BCa
function stops with &quot;BCa: alpha value too extreme for these data&quot; when this
condition arises.
</p>
<p>If the theta function returns few distinct values, whether due to a small or
homogeneous sample or an intrinsic property of theta, the bias correction
and consequently the BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> interval become erratic.  For
example, if x=c(1,2) and theta=mean, only three distinct values are returned
(25 % 1, 50 % 1.5, 25 % 2), <i>z<sub>0</sub></i> is forced away from zero, and the intervals
produced by BC<sub><i>a</i></sub> are skewed.  In this case the simpler methods that
do not attempt to correct for bias are more reliable:
