Description: Function BCa finds confidence intervals using Efron's
  nonparametric bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap method.  It is
  an enhanced derivative of the function bcanon, forked from
  bootstrap_2012.04-1.  Adaptive determination of the number of bootstrap
  replications is supported and the amount of memory required is less by a
  factor of nboot.
