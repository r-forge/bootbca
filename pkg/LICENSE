 This package was based on function bcanon in the "ORPHANED" R package
 bootstrap_2012.04-1 from cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootstrap/
 but was significantly enhanced.  Functional differences include:

   1. Implement adaptive bootstrap.
   2. Reduce memory required by a factor of nboot.
   3. Utilize the quantile function from stats, replacing code that contained
      an off-by-one error.
   4. Add option to use different types of quantiles.
   5. Eliminate superfluous returns; add returns for bootstrap estimate,
      attained precision, and the number of bootstrap replications done.
   6. Change default alpha to just c(0.025,0.975).
   7. Add some error checks.
   8. If all values in x are the same, skip the bootstrap and return
      theta(x,...) for all requested quantiles.

 These enhancements were made by David Flater <dflater@nist.gov> in the
 course of official duties.  Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the
 United States Code, the enhancements are not subject to copyright
 protection and are in the public domain.  To the extent that this is a
 derivative work, however, the previous copyrights would apply.

 Subsequently, maintenance of the bootstrap package was resumed by Scott
 Kostyshak (rev. 2014.4).

 The S StatLib package was by Rob Tibshirani to accompany the book "An
 Introduction to the Bootstrap" by Bradley Efron and Robert J. Tibshirani,
 1993.
